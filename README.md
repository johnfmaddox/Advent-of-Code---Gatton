# Gatton Academy Winter Break Coding Challenge

## General Information

Advent of Code is an annual, public, 25-day coding challenge where a new problem is published each day from Dec. 1 through Dec. 25.  Two puzzles are released each day, and you can only access the second puzzle after solving the first puzzle.  You get 1 star for each puzzle you solve and the leaderboard tracks who solves the puzzles first (for tie-breaking).  While the puzzles are the same for everyone, each participant starts with a different data set as their puzzle input so each person reaches a unique correct answer.  The puzzles are programming language agnostic, so you can use any language you like (Java, MATLAB, Python, etc.).

## Authentication

Advent of Code uses OAuth to confirm your identity: GitHub, Google, Twitter, or Reddit.  You will need to log in using one of those services.  GitHub is a popular hosting service used by many software developers.  So, if you don't already have a GitHub account, this is a good opportunity to start one.

## Gatton Academy Leaderboard

A Gatton-specific leaderboard will be used to track your progress and select winners for the competition. 

* Log in to Advent of Code (https://adventofcode.com/)
* Click on [Leaderboard] then select [Private Leaderboard] (https://adventofcode.com/2023/leaderboard/private)
* Join the Gatton Academy Leaderboard using the code:  2309876-dea04dcf
* Fill out the following entry form so your wing gets credit for your submissions: [Entry Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKIdDojTGqca3GCyVP9d74TH23Ecx4EEzcaXE-psQQDkltAw/viewform?usp=sf_link)
* Submit your results for the problems through the AoC site to earn Stars
* SAVE YOUR CODE!!!  Advent of Code does not require you to submit your code, however you will be required to submit your source code for each problem at the end of the Gatton competition to receive credit. 

## Scoring/Rules/Prizes

The state of the Gatton leaderboard at midnight (Central) on December 31, 2022 will be used to declare winners for the competition.  While the leaderboard will remain open indefinitely, any submissions in 2023 will not be counted toward the competition scoring. Winners will be declared in the following categories:

* Highest Scoring Wing (group scoring: {# stars}/{# wing residents}) - Trophy
* Participation (all students earning at least 5 stars) - Pizza Party during the spring semester

## Solution Sharing/Publishing

At the conclusion of the competition, you will need to submit the code you developed for each puzzle using the following form: [Source Code Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeKIdDojTGqca3GCyVP9d74TH23Ecx4EEzcaXE-psQQDkltAw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  
These solutions will be uploaded to a publicly accessible [location](https://github.com/johnfmaddox/Advent-of-Code---Gatton/), so you can see how your peers solved the problems.  Organize your work in a simple folder structure on your computer with a new folder for each day.  Instructions will be provided to upload your work at the end of the competition.
You can see the solutions submitted from previous years in this repository.
